Welcome to my Github Repository for the Twitch API and the Kappa Gem
Here is the code I originally wrote in order to begin to understand
how to access API's and how to install and use Gems.

To visit the Twitch API visit http://dev.twitch.tv
To visit the RubyGems page on the Kappa Gem visit https://rubygems.org/gems/kappa/versions/1.0.2

I used version 1.0.2 of the gem in this build
The bundler is built in and will download the required gems if you run: bundle install
while in the home directory for this repo.

My post will eventually be on Medium.
You can find me @rhoprhh on Medium
